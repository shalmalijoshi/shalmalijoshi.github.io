# Plain-Academic Template
A truly simple template for academics.


It was developed with simplicity in mind (both in terms of style and in code complexity).


An [example site](http://mavroud.is) built with this template, [another one](http://andreacerulli.github.io/) and [another one](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Bootle/).


If you are using it drop me a line!

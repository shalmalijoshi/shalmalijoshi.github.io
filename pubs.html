	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Multiview clustering is a framework for grouping objects given<br>               multiple views, e.g. text and image views describing the same<br>               set of entities. This paper introduces co-regularization<br>               techniques for multiview clustering that explicitly minimize a<br>               weighted sum of divergences to impose coherence between per-view<br>               learned models. Specifically, we iteratively minimize a weighted<br>               sum of divergences between posterior memberships of clusterings,<br>               thus learning view-specific parameters that produce similar<br>               clusterings across views. We explore a flexible family of<br>               divergences, namely R&eacute;nyi divergences for co-regularization.<br>               An existing method of probabilistic multiview clustering is<br>               recovered as a special case of the proposed method. Extensive<br>               empirical evaluation suggests improved performance over a<br>               variety of existing multiview clustering techniques as well as<br>               related methods developed for information fusion with multiview<br>               data.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This work proposes a new algorithm for automated and<br>                simultaneous phenotyping of multiple co-occurring medical<br>                conditions, also referred to as comorbidities, using clinical<br>                notes from electronic health records (EHRs). A latent factor<br>                estimation technique, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF),<br>                is augmented with domain constraints from weak supervision to<br>                obtain sparse latent factors that are grounded to a fixed set<br>                of chronic conditions. The proposed grounding mechanism ensures<br>                a one-to-one identifiable and interpretable mapping between the<br>                latent factors and the target comorbidities. Qualitative<br>                assessment of the empirical results by clinical experts show<br>                that the proposed model learns clinically interpretable<br>                phenotypes which are also shown to have competitive performance<br>                on 30 day mortality prediction task. The proposed method can be<br>                readily adapted to any non-negative EHR data across various<br>                healthcare institutions.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We propose a novel approach for simultaneous exploratory<br>               analysis and prognosis of multiple chronic conditions that can<br>               enable healthcare professionals to harness the vast amounts of<br>               medical data available in electronic health records (EHRs) in a<br>               comprehensive manner for early treatment, the discovery of<br>               previously unknown symptoms and exploration of new associations<br>               in the context of individual chronic conditions. In particular,<br>               this manuscript focuses on the use of early clinical notes<br>               available in EHRs to diagnose multiple chronic conditions. While<br>               most methods for EHR analysis have focused on single disease<br>               predictions, multiple conditions called comorbidities tend to<br>               occur simultaneously with the primary chronic condition in many<br>               patients. To this end, we model each chronic condition as a<br>               latent variable in a novel supervised topic model which results<br>               in the prediction of multiple illnesses associated with each<br>               patient. In addition, the supervised topic model also provides<br>               an interpretable graphical visualization of each chronic<br>               condition for detailed exploratory analysis. We compare the<br>               proposed model to relevant state-of-the art methods,<br>               demonstrating both its quantitative and qualitative merits.</td>
